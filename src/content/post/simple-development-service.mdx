# What is General Development Service?

GDS let's you have access to all our talents: UI, development, admin, business dev, copywriting. All this at same time, for as long there are tasks available. 

It was created to allow us to offer Marketing Automation and similar services that require varied talents to be working together on tasks.

This is flexible offering of development services that you can use whenever there is not completely clarity what needs to be done.

# Is this not opposite of our other offerings?

It is, but it is what our clients needed. 

We were looking how to offer Marketing Automation as a service. It requires a lot of admin, some development, some UI, copywriting. We really can't anticipate needs and what will be asked from us, so for now this is ideal way to offer our expertise in format we all know and love: simple and affordable expert service.

# How does it work?

Usually it starts with your need as a client, maybe you would like us to install marketing automation. Initial work is fairly easy to estimate but based on how your audience responds, different actions might be needed. Maybe we need to update pages for SEO, maybe your campaign should be supported by content and social media campaign. Maybe we need to create and automate some landing pages to make things flow.

Our idea is that we will meet once a week with you, see how things are going and what we can do next, and whenever there is something interesting is happening.

Also this offering allow us to have flexible offer for anyone who is not yet sure where things will go.

Who knows, maybe this will become our most popular service.

# What should I do if I need work to be done faster?

Oh, that is simple. Just add another GDS resource, or if there is specialty that you most often use, like UI, this would work.
