# Why we are changing website so much?

#### Hey there, you must be wondering, or not at all: Why are you changing your site again?

Main reason for change is that previous site is based on template that wasn't flexible. I couldn't add blog as well as I can do here and features I plan to demo here are much better served with this template. Updates were hard to do, and on mobile devices, even though it had relatively high Lighthouse score, page effects would block some of the pages for a little bit.

Current site is not as pretty, but it is very functional and conveys information well. It is also flexible and we will be able to add more features and make it as pretty as previous one in time.

#### Main reason for switch

I would like to demo how you can have multilingual site and blog for example. AI is really good at translating, but implementing such site is not trivial, so I needed better foundation to be able to feature such technology.

I think current template is really good for that and for future client work I plan to use this template as well. It has numerous features and organization of code is such that is very suitable for custom work.

When you are building new software or website, you really don't want to invent everything even if you can. If someone did a good work, and often there is such elements or templates available, you should use it and use your work to make business features that would add value.

I will start writing about what we do and how we do it and how we can create value and make your business more succesful.

#### That's all!

Off to work on client project!
