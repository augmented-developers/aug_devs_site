At **Augmented Devs**, we accelerate tech projects at lightning speed by combining **senior-level expertise** with an **on-demand engagement model**. Whether you're a **startup founder** looking to validate your idea or a **CTO** aiming to scale efficiently, our approach ensures high-quality results with unmatched speed.

We start almost every engagement with a smaller, focused project at **$2.5K per week**, personally led by me. Once weâ€™re aligned on goals and tasks, we ramp up to tackle larger initiatives. Our **Sprint-based approach** ensures that each phase has a clear set of goals, enabling rapid execution and consistent progress.

## **Sprint Planning Using the Now, Next, Later Framework**

To ensure that each Sprint delivers maximum value, we follow the **Now, Next, Later** framework to plan and prioritize tasks:

- **Next:** Upcoming tasks that will be addressed in the following Sprint based on evolving priorities.
- **Later:** Future initiatives that are documented for long-term planning but not yet prioritized.

This framework provides **clarity and structure** in our approach, helping us align with your business objectives and pivot quickly when needed.
