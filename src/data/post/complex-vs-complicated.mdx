I came across a Harvard Business Review article that explores the difference between complicated and complex business problems. It provides valuable insights on how to identify and effectively address each type. I found it particularly resonant with the challenges I face at work, as it echoed many of the conclusions I’ve reached, but presented them more eloquently.

I included both the link to original article as well as my notes:

#### **Main Ideas**

1. **Complicated vs. Complex Problems:**
   - **Complicated:** These are like big puzzles with clear pieces. You need expertise and a step-by-step plan to solve them. Think engineering projects or launching new software.
   - **Complex:** These are more like tangled knots where things are always changing. You need to be flexible and ready to adapt. Examples include handling a pandemic or navigating shifting market trends.

2. **Real-World Examples:**
   - **Best Buy and Covid-19:** CEO Corie Barry faced the pandemic by setting clear priorities (safety first, avoid layoffs, focus on long-term value) and adapting as things changed, instead of sticking to their usual rigid methods.
   - **Tylenol vs. Boeing 737 MAX:**
     - **Tylenol Crisis:** A complicated problem where Johnson & Johnson acted quickly and systematically to recall products and ensure safety.
     - **Boeing 737 MAX Crisis:** A complex issue with many stakeholders and no clear solution, requiring ongoing adaptation and collaboration.

3. **Impact of a VUCA World:**
   - **VUCA:** Stands for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous.
   - The modern business world is full of interconnected crises, making problems more complex than before. Leaders need new skills to handle this complexity.

4. **Six Steps to Manage Complex Problems:**
   - **1. Stick to Your Mission and Values:** Let your core principles guide your decisions.
   - **2. Fully Understand the Problem:** Look beyond the surface to see all the factors at play.
   - **3. Stay Flexible:** Be ready to change your approach as the situation evolves.
   - **4. Use Real-Time Feedback:** Continuously gather and respond to feedback.
   - **5. Engage All Stakeholders:** Involve everyone affected to get diverse perspectives.
   - **6. Develop Adaptive Leaders:** Train leaders to think creatively and handle ambiguity.

5. **Case Study – Nestlé’s Maggi Noodles Crisis:**
   - Faced with safety allegations in India, Nestlé used the six-step approach to navigate the crisis, engage stakeholders, and eventually relaunched Maggi successfully.

   - Involve all relevant stakeholders to get a wide range of insights and build trust.
6. **Set Up Feedback Loops:**
   - Create systems to gather and act on feedback quickly, helping you stay responsive to changes.

#### **Putting It All Together**

By doing so, your organization can navigate uncertainties, innovate effectively, and thrive even in a volatile world.
