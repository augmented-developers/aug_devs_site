# How Augmented Developers Plan Products with a Now, Next, Later Roadmap

At Augmented Developers, we believe that simplicity is the key to success. Whether we’re building MVPs for startups or supporting scaling teams, we strive to use simple tools and processes that empower us to work effectively and focus on what truly matters. One of the tools that has consistently proven its value is the **Now, Next, Later (NNL) roadmap**.

This straightforward yet powerful framework helps us prioritize, plan, and adapt with ease, ensuring we deliver meaningful outcomes for our clients. Here’s how the NNL roadmap works and why it has become an essential part of our process.

## What is a Now, Next, Later Roadmap?

The Now, Next, Later roadmap organizes product initiatives across three dynamic time horizons:

1. **Now:** The current, high-priority tasks that are fully defined and ready for execution.
2. **Next:** The near-term focus, containing initiatives that are clear but not yet urgent.
3. **Later:** The big-picture ideas and goals that are on the horizon but not immediately actionable.

This approach gives us the flexibility to focus on immediate deliverables while keeping an eye on future opportunities.

## Why the Now, Next, Later Roadmap Works for Us

1. **Aligned with Our Lean Philosophy**  
   At Augmented Developers, we prioritize efficiency and effectiveness. The NNL roadmap aligns perfectly with our lean development process, allowing us to avoid wasted effort and concentrate on impactful work.

2. **Flexibility Meets Focus**  
   The NNL framework provides the structure we need to move forward with confidence while leaving room to adapt. This balance ensures we deliver high-quality solutions, even in the face of shifting priorities.

3. **Clear Communication**  
   This roadmap simplifies communication with clients and stakeholders. It makes our priorities clear, explains what’s in progress, and shows what’s coming next without overwhelming anyone with unnecessary details.

4. **Drives Better Decisions**  
   By focusing on problems over features and tying initiatives back to business objectives, we make decisions that drive real value, both for our team and our clients.

## How We Use the NNL Roadmap

### 1. Now: Focus on Immediate Impact

- This column includes initiatives currently in progress. Each task is well-defined and ready for action.
- **Example:** Building the first version of a feature critical for MVP launch.

### 2. Next: Preparing for What’s Ahead

- The Next column holds initiatives that are ready to follow once Now tasks are completed. These ideas are clear but not yet fully scoped.
- **Example:** Adding user feedback integration based on initial beta testing.

### 3. Later: Envisioning the Future

- Later items reflect long-term ideas and strategic goals. These initiatives remain loosely defined but guide our vision for future development.
- **Example:** Exploring AI-powered analytics for enhanced user insights.

## How This Roadmap Serves Our Clients

Our clients value the transparency and adaptability this approach offers. For startup founders, it’s a roadmap that provides clarity without overcommitting to uncertain timelines. For scaling teams, it’s a tool that keeps priorities aligned with business objectives while maintaining room for innovation. In every case, the NNL roadmap helps us deliver results quickly and efficiently.

## Best Practices and Lessons Learned

- **Prioritize Problems, Not Features**  
   Start with the problems your product needs to solve, then outline solutions in the roadmap.

- **Stay Aligned with Objectives**  
   Tie each initiative back to business goals to maintain strategic focus.

- **Keep It Lean**  
   Avoid overloading any column. Focus on what’s most valuable and feasible.

- **Regularly Review and Adjust**  
   Treat the roadmap as a living document that evolves with new data and changing priorities.
