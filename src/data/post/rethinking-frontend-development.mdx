Over the years, I’ve observed a recurring tension in web development—one that often arises from the frameworks we rely on, like React or Angular. On one hand, these tools offer a convenient, streamlined way for organizations to manage complex user interfaces and state. On the other, they frequently lead to performance issues, accessibility challenges, and user frustration.

This tension isn’t just about tools or trends. It’s about how we think organizationally versus what’s truly good for the end user. Let’s explore this balance and how we can build better web applications by shifting our approach.

## **Organizational Thinking vs. User-Centered Thinking**

Frameworks like React became popular because they solve a lot of problems for developers and organizations. They:

- Enable teams to create standardized, reusable components.
- Simplify state management and UI updates.
- Foster rapid prototyping and scaling for complex applications.

But what’s convenient for an organization isn’t always what’s best for the end user. From the user’s perspective, performance, accessibility, and speed matter far more than the tools used to build the product. A website that loads quickly, works reliably across devices, and doesn’t overwhelm their browser creates a much better experience—yet this is often deprioritized when organizational convenience takes center stage.

The key challenge is finding a balance. We need solutions that serve organizational needs without sacrificing user experience.

## **The Rule of Least Client-Side Complexity**

One of the most effective ways to achieve this balance is to minimize client-side complexity. Client-side JavaScript operates in unpredictable environments, where users’ devices, browsers, and network conditions vary dramatically. Every additional dependency or line of JavaScript you introduce increases the risk of performance bottlenecks, especially for users with older devices or slower connections.

Instead of adding complexity by default, consider how to simplify:

- Use HTML and CSS as your foundation. They’re efficient, resilient, and degrade gracefully.
- Be judicious with JavaScript, treating it as a tool for enhancements, not a requirement.

This approach isn’t about avoiding modern tools—it’s about using them thoughtfully to prioritize the user’s experience.

## **Alternatives to Framework-Heavy Approaches**

If heavy frameworks like React aren’t always the best choice, what should we turn to? Here are some alternatives that balance organizational convenience with user-centered outcomes:

### **1. Progressive Enhancement**

Start by building core functionality with server-rendered HTML and CSS. Use JavaScript to progressively enhance the experience where appropriate. This ensures accessibility and performance across all devices and conditions.

### **2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

Deliver fully rendered HTML directly from the server to improve load times and SEO. Frameworks like Next.js can simplify SSR, though they often tie you to React. For lighter, faster results, explore SSR without relying on heavy client-side frameworks.

### **3. Static Site Generators (SSGs)**

Static site generators like Astro, Jekyll, or Hugo pre-render pages during the build process. Users receive lightweight HTML, reducing server load and improving performance. This approach works especially well for content-driven websites.

### **4. Lean JavaScript Frameworks**

Explore lightweight frameworks like Svelte, SolidJS, or Preact. These tools offer modern reactivity and interactivity while maintaining small footprints for better user performance.

### **5. Custom Vanilla JavaScript**

Sometimes, the simplest solution is best. Writing custom JavaScript for specific tasks eliminates unnecessary overhead and gives you complete control over the user experience.

## **Why Organizations Default to React (and How to Shift the Thinking)**

Organizations often lean on React because it’s familiar, widely adopted, and perceived as a safe choice. But this default thinking can overshadow better, simpler options. To shift this mindset:

- **Focus on the User Experience**: Frame decisions around what will serve the user best, not what’s easiest for the team.
- **Measure Performance**: Track metrics like page load time, interactivity, and accessibility to guide technology choices.
- **Diversify Skills**: Train teams to work with alternatives like SSGs or vanilla JavaScript. This reduces reliance on specific frameworks and broadens technical capabilities.
- **Evaluate Context**: React might be ideal for certain applications, but it’s worth asking: is this project one of them? For many sites, simpler solutions deliver better results.

---

## **The Broader Impact of Better Choices**

When we focus on simplicity and performance, the benefits extend beyond the user. Teams also gain from reduced technical debt, faster load times in development, and greater flexibility in adapting to future needs.

This isn’t about abandoning React entirely—it’s about moving away from the “React by default” mindset. By carefully considering each project’s needs and choosing tools that align with its goals, we create products that benefit users, teams, and organizations alike.

## **A Call to Reevaluate Our Tools**

The web has evolved, and so must our tools and practices. React and similar frameworks still have their place, especially in highly interactive applications. But for many projects, simpler approaches will deliver better results. By prioritizing user needs and minimizing complexity, we can ensure the web remains a fast, accessible, and delightful place for everyone.

The next time you start a project, ask yourself: are we choosing React for the right reasons—or just out of habit? Making thoughtful decisions about our tools is a step toward a better web for everyone.
