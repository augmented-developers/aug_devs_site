## How I Got Alex Hormozi to Be My Advisor (Well, Sort of...)

If you’re reading this, you’ve probably heard of Alex Hormozi. The guy’s a beast when it comes to business advice, and his YouTube channel is packed with gold for anyone looking to scale up their business. But here's the thing: there’s so much content—over 5,000 transcripts!—that trying to absorb it all can feel like drinking from a firehose.

That’s where I got creative. What if I could take all that content and turn it into a personal advisor I could chat with on demand? Enter Google NotebookLM and later, a more advanced tool called RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Let me show you how I did it.

### Step 1: The Power of Content—Alex Hormozi’s Business Wisdom

First off, let’s talk about Alex. He’s been dropping knowledge bombs on YouTube, breaking down complex business strategies into actionable steps. As a tech entrepreneur and coach, I’ve always been a fan of his “get stuff done” mindset. But, like many of you, I’ve struggled with staying on top of all his valuable content.

With over 5,000 transcripts, the information is immense, and it's impossible to process everything manually. I realized I needed a way to access his advice faster, in real time. That's when I decided to bring in AI to help.

### Step 2: Creating an Alex Hormozi Avatar with Google NotebookLM

Google NotebookLM is a pretty cool tool that lets you interact with content in ways that are beyond just reading. So, naturally, I thought, "Why not feed Alex’s content into this thing and create an AI avatar?" After all, if I can have a virtual Jake (yeah, I’m the kind of guy who enjoys experimenting with this stuff), why not a virtual Alex?

I managed to load about 100 transcripts into NotebookLM, which is still just a fraction of his full library. But it worked. I could ask the avatar for business advice and get responses as if I were chatting directly with Alex Hormozi. Pretty neat, right?

But here’s the rub: NotebookLM is limited in how much content it can handle. I was only able to load about 100 transcripts—just scratching the surface of Alex’s entire repository. That’s when I realized I needed something more powerful to truly tap into the entire wealth of content.

### Step 3: The Next Step—RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Now, this is where things get interesting. RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a game-changer. Unlike Google NotebookLM, which can only handle small datasets, RAG allows you to retrieve data in real time from a much larger collection—like, say, all 5,000+ Alex Hormozi transcripts.

So, how does RAG work? Basically, it’s a hybrid AI approach that combines document retrieval with text generation. Imagine it like this: instead of preloading a limited number of transcripts, RAG dynamically pulls in the most relevant information from the full dataset as you ask questions. This gives you accurate, context-rich responses based on everything Alex has said, not just a small slice of it.

Implementing a RAG system was a fun challenge. I used some great open-source tools to pull it together, and suddenly, I had access to all of Alex’s wisdom, whenever I needed it. It was like having the man himself on speed dial, but with AI.

### Step 4: My Takeaway—A Fun Project with Real Results

Building this virtual Alex Hormozi advisor was a blast. It felt like combining the best of both worlds—cutting-edge AI and one of the sharpest business minds around. The best part? I could interact with his advice at my own pace, whenever I needed it.

While this project was mostly for fun, it highlighted something important: AI tools like NotebookLM and RAG are incredible for scaling access to large datasets of valuable content. If you’re in the coaching or entrepreneurial space, this could change the game for how you consume and act on advice from experts like Alex.

So no, I didn’t _actually_ get Alex Hormozi to be my advisor, but thanks to AI, I got pretty darn close.
