    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      You don’t need more code; you need strategic advice and clear direction. With biweekly sessions, I’ll be your
      active advisor and mentor helping you navigate business, technology, and personal challenges. We’ll discuss your
      project’s architecture, your team, and your tech strategy in a way that tackles both high-level decisions and
      day-to-day obstacles.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      I’ve been where you are—leading projects, managing teams, and trying to make sense of overwhelming challenges.
      I've dealt with the stress of never having enough time, feeling stuck in the details, and questioning whether I
      was truly leading with impact. That’s why I’m here to offer you the help, support, and guidance I wish I’d had.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      These biweekly sessions will not only help you simplify complex issues and overcome roadblocks, but also drive you
      towards specific, tangible outcomes. Together, we’ll work on achieving <strong>promotions</strong>, finding <strong
        >better job satisfaction</strong
      >, pursuing <strong>more meaningful work</strong>, and ultimately <strong>working fewer hours</strong> while still
      delivering outstanding results.
