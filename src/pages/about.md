**Foundation and Vision**

Augmented Developers was founded in October 2023 by Zeljko Dakic, based in Chicago. While we are located in Chicago, our goal is to transcend geographical boundaries and work globally. Our mission is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to innovate and streamline the software development process.

**Origins and Motivation**

The inception of Augmented Developers stems from my frustration with corporate constraints. Despite working on exciting and innovative projects within large conglomerates and leading development teams, I often felt restricted in making a significant impact. Recognizing the immense potential of AI, I decided to venture out and explore its applications in software development.

**AI and the Future of Development**

I believe that while AI may not write complete applications in the near future, it has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of development. AI can help clarify vague ideas, create detailed software and infrastructure plans, and assist in organizing and resourcing projects. It can streamline brainstorming, support developers in focusing on business rules rather than syntax, and ultimately accelerate the development process.

**What Makes Us Augmented**

At Augmented Developers, our name embodies our philosophy. We enhance traditional development practices with cutting-edge AI technology, making our processes more efficient and effective. Our use of AI allows us to:

- Clarify Ideas: AI helps in transforming vague concepts into clear, actionable plans.
- Optimize Planning: AI generates detailed software and infrastructure plans that only require minimal adjustments.
- Support Development: AI assists in brainstorming features and automating routine tasks, enabling developers to focus on critical business logic.
- Accelerate Delivery: By leveraging AI, we reduce development time and deliver high-quality solutions faster.

**Our Inspiration**

Inspired by these possibilities, I embarked on a journey to create something different, yet grounded in my previous experiences. Augmented Developers aims to leverage AI to simplify and enhance the software development process.
