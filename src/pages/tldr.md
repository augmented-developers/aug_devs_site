## **How Augmented Devs Builds Faster with Senior Engineers**

**Augmented Devs** combines **senior product engineers** with an **on-demand, Sprint-based engagement model** to help startups and mid-sized companies build MVPs, integrate AI solutions, and provide full-cycle support.

### **Why Choose Us?**

- **Faster MVP Development:** We deliver MVPs in weeks, not months, by focusing on core features. Our process follows a simple, proven flow: **develop idea, prototype, build, launch, and support.**
- **AI-Augmented Workflow:** We leverage AI to brainstorm, plan, prototype, assist with coding, create test plans, and generate documentationâ€”boosting efficiency while maintaining quality.
- **Best for Creation:** We excel in **greenfield projects** and **MVP development**, making us the ideal partner for launching new products. But we deliver great benefits also on bigger codebases and refactoring projects.
- **Sprint-Based Execution:** We use Sprints to focus on high-impact tasks while adapting priorities as the project evolves. Tasks are organized using the **Now, Next, Later** framework:
  - **Now:** Current Sprint tasks that align with immediate goals.
  - **Next:** Upcoming tasks to address in future Sprints.
  - **Later:** Longer-term initiatives documented for future planning.
- **Full Access and Control:** Clients always have complete access to their code and resourcesâ€”no vendor lock-in.
- **Fair and Transparent Pricing:** Our rates are the same for everyone and they start at **$2.5K per week, billed 2 weeks in advance.**
- **US-Based Talent with Global Expansion:** Our current team is **100% US-based**, but as a remote-first company, we are **looking globally** to attract the best talent.

### **What We Expect from You:**

- **Frequent Collaboration:** We expect clients to be present and guide our work frequently to ensure alignment and success.
- **Clear Communication and Guidance:** Regular feedback helps us fine-tune deliverables and keep the project on track.

### **Our Philosophy:**

- **Balance of Success and Happiness:** Our goal is to ensure a balance between your success and our team's happiness, creating a positive and sustainable partnership.
