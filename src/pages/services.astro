      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We are excited to offer a new training program designed to help organizations apply AI in development. This
        structured and clear approach will guide you through the process of integrating AI into your projects.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The training spans 3 weeks, with 3-4 workshops per week. You will learn how to apply AI in your projects and
        lead AI initiatives. The curriculum covers developing requirements, creating prototypes, producing design
        systems, structuring applications, writing code and tests, creating database models, and planning
        deployments—all with the help of AI.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        This program is ideal for lead developers, product owners, and other senior roles within your organization.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
        <strong>Testimonial:</strong> "The AI training program was a game-changer for our team. We walked away with two critical
        skills that have transformed our workflow: AI-powered code generation, which cuts our development time by 30%, and
        intelligent debugging tools that help us catch and resolve issues much faster. It wasn’t just training—it was a practical
        roadmap for integrating AI into our development process. We learned a lot while enjoying every moment." - Michael
        Harris, Product Owner at Stealth Startup
